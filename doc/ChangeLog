	* This revision will not compile. Due to limitations in case 
	  insensitivethe filesystems subversion can not do casechanging
	  file renames in reliably. This version contains temporary 
	  renames of some files that makes the package unusable.

	* Added clipboard functionality. ctypes clipboard code 
	  borrowed from example code posted to ctypes-users. See
	  http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/ctypes-users/1771866
	* Control-Shift-v moved quoted insert from Control-v
	* Control-v straight paste from clipboard
	* Alt-v ipython_paste. Does some preprocessing of data. If 
	  clipboard text is shorter than 300 characters and has no 
	  newlines and tabs, then assume it is a path and change all 
	  \ to / and then add \ before all spaces. This means you can 
	  paste paths and use them in magic command %cd. If text is 
	  multiline it assumes tabseparated data should be list of 
	  list, if all is numeric assume it should be an array.
	* Control-y yank, alias for Control-v.
	* Control-k kill line, move text from cursor to end of line 
	  into clipboard. Should be move to kill buffer but the kill 
	  buffer is not implemented.
	* Added kill line and yank functionality. As well as mark and 
	  copy-region-to-clipboard.
	* Control-m set-mark sets the copy region mark
	* Control-q copies region between mark and cursor to clipboard
	* Changed version in setup.py to 1.13-svn

	  lucida terminal, this is done in the properties dialog of 
	  the terminal.
